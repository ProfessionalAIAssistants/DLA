# Dashboard Double-Click Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the CRM dashboard to make all task items, overdue tasks, recent quotes, closing opportunities, and recent activities double-clickable to navigate to their respective detail pages.

- Added CSS classes for hover effects (`task-item`)
- Added `cursor: pointer` styling
- Added tooltips with "Double-click to view details"

<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center border-bottom py-2 task-item" 
     ondblclick="window.location.href='{{ url_for('task_detail', task_id=task.id) }}'" 
     style="cursor: pointer;" 
     title="Double-click to view details">
```

## CSS Enhancements

### Hover Effects
- Added smooth transitions for all clickable items
- Implemented hover states with background color changes
- Added subtle box shadows and transform effects
- Added colored left borders on hover for visual differentiation:
  - Tasks: Blue border (#007bff)
  - RFQs: Green border (#28a745) 
  - Opportunities: Yellow border (#ffc107)
  - Interactions: Purple border (#6f42c1)

### Visual Feedback
- Pointer cursor for all clickable items
- Tooltips explaining double-click functionality
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease-in-out)

## Routes Used
The implementation leverages existing Flask routes:
- `task_detail` - Task detail pages

- `opportunity_detail` - Opportunity detail pages
- `interaction_detail` - Interaction/Activity detail pages

## User Experience Improvements

### Accessibility
- Visual indicators (cursor changes, hover effects)
- Tooltips providing guidance
- Non-intrusive design that doesn't interfere with existing functionality

### Functionality Preservation
- Existing buttons and links continue to work normally
- Event propagation properly managed to prevent conflicts
- Complete task buttons still work independently

### Responsive Design
- Hover effects work across different screen sizes
- Transitions provide smooth user experience
- Maintains existing responsive layout

## Testing
The application has been tested and confirmed working:
- All double-click events navigate correctly
- Existing functionality preserved
- Visual feedback working as expected
- No JavaScript errors or conflicts

## Browser Compatibility
The implementation uses standard web technologies:
- Standard DOM events (ondblclick)
- CSS3 transitions and transforms
- Modern CSS selectors
- Compatible with all modern browsers

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Right-click context menus
- Keyboard navigation support
- Drag and drop functionality
